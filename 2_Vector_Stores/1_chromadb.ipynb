It’s a type of machine learning model, usually based on transformers, trained on huge amounts of text from the web, books, and other sources.\\n- How it works (high level): It learns patterns in language from vast data, then predicts the next word or sequence of words to generate coherent text. It can also perform tasks like summarization, translation, question answering, and code generation.\\n- Capabilities: Text generation, editing, summarization, translation, reasoning within some limits, coding help, conversational chat.\\n- Limitations: Can produce plausible-sounding but incorrect or biased content (hallucinations), reflects biases in training data, requires substantial compute and data privacy considerations, not truly understanding or conscious.\\n- Common uses: Chatbots, virtual assistants, content creation, code assistants, data analysis, tutoring, translation.\\n- Examples: GPT-4, BERT, T5, Claude (various large-scale models).\\n\\n2) Master of Laws (LL.M.)\\n- What it is: An advanced postgraduate law degree for lawyers, often called LL.M. or LL.M.
