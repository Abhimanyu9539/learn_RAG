    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Autonomous RAG acts more intelligently by:\n",
    "\n",
    "Deciding if retrieval is needed - It can answer directly from its knowledge when appropriate, or retrieve information when needed\n",
    "Choosing what to retrieve - It can determine which sources or types of information would be most useful\n",
    "Iterating adaptively - It can perform multiple retrieval steps, refining its search based on what it finds\n",
    "\n",
    "Self-Reflection: The system can evaluate whether retrieved information is sufficient or if it needs to search again with different queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tool Integration: Beyond just document retrieval, autonomous RAG systems can decide to use calculators, call APIs, query databases, or use other tools as needed."

    "## 9. Corrective RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "- Focuses on improving the accuracy and relevance of generated response by incorporating mechanism of self grading and self reflection of retrieved documents\n",
    "- It does this by evaluating the quality of retrieved documents and applying corrective actions when necessary, such as refining or replacing incorrect retrievals.\n",

    "### Addressing Limitations of Basic RAG:\n",
    "Traditional RAG systems rely heavily on the accuracy of retrieved documents. If the retrieved information is flawed or incomplete, the generated response can also be inaccurate.\n",

    "### CRAG's Core Components:\n",
    "1. Retrieval Evaluator: This component assesses the quality and relevance of retrieved documents.\n",

    "3. Refinement and Correction: CRAG employs strategies like knowledge refinement or web search to address issues identified by the retrieval evaluator.\n",

    "1. Improved Accuracy: By evaluating and correcting retrieved information, CRAG helps ensure the accuracy of\n",
