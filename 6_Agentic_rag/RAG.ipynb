    "### Autonomous RAG acts more intelligently by:\n",
    "\n",
    "Deciding if retrieval is needed - It can answer directly from its knowledge when appropriate, or retrieve information when needed\n",
    "Choosing what to retrieve - It can determine which sources or types of information would be most useful\n",
    "Iterating adaptively - It can perform multiple retrieval steps, refining its search based on what it finds\n",
    "\n",
    "Self-Reflection: The system can evaluate whether retrieved information is sufficient or if it needs to search again with different queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tool Integration: Beyond just document retrieval, autonomous RAG systems can decide to use calculators, call APIs, query databases, or use other tools as needed."
